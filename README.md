# OutFista
An AI-powered fashion discovery platform combining image, video, and NLP-based search with Virtual Try-On (VTON). Users can find and try outfits through visuals or natural language, using deep learning for accurate, real-time fashion matching and seamless shopping integration.

OutFista ‚Äì AI-Powered Fashion Discovery Platform

OutFista is an advanced AI-based fashion search and try-on platform that helps users discover, visualize, and shop for fashion items intelligently. It integrates image-based, video-based**, and text (NLP)-based search capabilities, along with Virtual Try-On (VTON) technology to create an immersive and personalized fashion experience.

Features

1. Image-Based Fashion Search

Upload or capture a clothing image to find visually similar fashion products using **computer vision** and **deep learning models**.

2. Video-Based Search

Extracts fashion items directly from **videos**, identifies the outfit pieces, and suggests similar styles from the database.

3. NLP-Based Search

Type what you‚Äôre looking for in natural language ‚Äî e.g. ‚Äúred floral summer dress under $100‚Äù ‚Äî and get intelligent search results powered by Natural Language Processing (NLP).

4. Virtual Try-On (VTON)

Enables users to virtually try clothing before purchasing. The system overlays apparel items onto user avatars or uploaded body images for a realistic preview.

5. Smart Matching & Recommendations

Combines multiple AI models to suggest items based on style similarity, color harmony, and fashion trends.
